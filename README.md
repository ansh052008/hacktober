# hacktober

Send any type of pull requests here. Add something interesting or just format the files. All pull requests containing anything, except contents offensive to any group or community or copyright infringing material, will be merged. It may take a while but all pull requests will be merged eventually.

I noticed that some people started sending pull requests that didn't add to the project just because they wanted to get Hacktober Fest swag. This just clutters the project's pull requests with non constructive pull requests. So I made this repository for you so send any pull request you want, just leave my other repositories alone.
